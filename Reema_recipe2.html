                 prepare and dress your salads so you can really enjoy them.</p>
            <p class="p2">You’ll need a selection of freshly picked lettuces such as round lettuce, oak leaf lettuce, lamb’s lettuce, watercress, cos lettuce, little gem lettuce, chicory and </br>
                radicchio (about 4 large handfuls). You’ll also need a jam jar dressing of your choice.</p>
            <p class="p2">To wash your salad leaves:</p>
            <p class="p2">When you get your lettuces home, remove the roots and any not-so-nice outside leaves first, then click or tear off the rest of the leaves and give them a good old wash </br>
                in cold water cialis sans ordonnance. Once they’re clean, give them a spin in a salad spinner or shake them dry in a tea towel.</p>
